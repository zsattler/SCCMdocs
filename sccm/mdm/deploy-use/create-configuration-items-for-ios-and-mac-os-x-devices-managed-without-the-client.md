# How to create configuration items for iOS and macOS devices managed with Intune

Use the System Center Configuration Manager **iOS and macOS** configuration item to manage settings  for iOS and macOS devices that are enrolled in Microsoft Intune or managed on-premises by Configuration Manager.  
  
## Create an iOS and macOS configuration item  
  
1. In the Configuration Manager console, click **Assets and compliance**.  
  
2. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then click **Configuration Items**.  
  
3. On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Configuration Item**.  
  
4. On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.  
  
5. Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, select **iOS and macOS**.  
  
6. Click **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the Configuration Manager console.  
  
7. On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, select the specific iOS, or macOS platforms that will evaluate the configuration item.  
  
8. On the **Device Settings** page of the wizard, select the settings group that you want to configure. See [iOS and macOS configuration item settings reference](#ios-and-macos-configuration-item-settings-reference) in this topic for details, and then click **Next**.  
  
   > [!TIP]  
   >  If the setting that you want is not listed, select the **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups check box**.  
  
9. On each settings page, configure the settings you require, and whether you want to remediate them when they are not compliant on devices (when this is supported).  
  
10. For each settings group, you can also configure the severity that will be reported when a configuration item is found to be noncompliant from:  
  
    -   **None** - Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Information** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Warning** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Critical** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Critical with event** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. This severity level is also be logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  
  
11. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that are not compatible with the supported platforms you selected earlier. You can go back and remove these settings, or you can continue.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  Unsupported settings are not assessed for compliance.  
  
12. Complete the wizard.  
  
    You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.

###  Compliant and noncompliant apps (iOS)  
 Let’s you specify a list of iOS apps that are compliant, or not compliant in your company. You can then use reports to display devices that have noncompliant apps installed, and the associated user.  
  
 You cannot specify both compliant and noncompliant apps in the same configuration item.  
  
#### To specify the compliant or noncompliant apps list  
  
1. On the **Compliant and Noncompliant Apps (iOS)** page, specify the following information:  
  
   -   **Noncompliant apps list** - Select this option if you want to specify a list of apps that will be reported as noncompliant if installed by users.  
  
   -   **Compliant apps list** - Select this option if you want to specify a list of apps that users are allowed to install. Any other installed apps will be reported as noncompliant.  
  
   -   **Add** - Adds an app to the selected list. Specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.  
  
        To specify the URL, from the iTunes App Store, search for the app you want to use.  
  
        Open the app’s page, and copy the URL to the clipboard. You can now use this as the URL in either the compliant or noncompliant apps list.  
  
        **Example:** Search the store for the **Microsoft Word for iPad** app. The URL you use will be **https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word-for-ipad/id586447913?mt=8**.  
  
   -   **Edit** - Let’s you edit the name, publisher and URL of the selected app.  
  
   -   **Remove** - Deletes the selected app from the list.  
  
   -   **Import** - Imports a list of apps you have specified in a comma-separated values file. Use the format, application name, publisher, app URL in the file.  
  
2. When you are finished, click **Next**.  
  
   You can use one of the following reports monitor compliant and noncompliant apps:  
  
- **List of noncompliant Apps and Devices for a specified user** - Displays information about users and devices that have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  
  
- **Summary of Users who have Noncompliant Apps** - Displays information about users that have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  
  
  For information about how to use reports, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/manage/reporting.md).  
  
###  Compliant and noncompliant apps (macOS)  
 Let’s you specify a list of macOS apps that are compliant, or not compliant in your company. You can then use reports to display devices that have noncompliant apps installed, and the associated user.  
  
 You cannot specify both compliant and noncompliant apps in the same configuration item.  
  
#### To specify the compliant or noncompliant apps list  
  
1. On the **Compliant and Noncompliant Apps (macOS)** page, specify the following information:

2. When you are finished, click **Next**.  
  
   You can use one of the following reports monitor compliant and noncompliant apps:  
  
- **List of noncompliant Apps and Devices for a specified user** - Displays information about users and devices that have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  
  
- **Summary of Users who have Noncompliant Apps** - Displays information about users that have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  
  
  For information about how to use reports, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/manage/reporting.md).  
  
### iOS and macOS custom profile settings  
 Use **iOS and macOS Custom Profiles** to deploy settings that you created using the [Apple Configurator tool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12) to iOS and macOS devices. This tool lets you create many settings that control the operation of these devices and export them to a configuration profile. You can then import this configuration profile into an iOS and macOS custom profile and deploy the settings to users and devices in your organization.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Ensure that the settings you export from the Apple Configurator tool are compatible with the version of iOS or macOS on the devices to which you deploy the profile. For information about how incompatible settings are resolved, search for Configuration Profile Reference and Mobile Device Management Protocol Reference on the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) web site.  
  
#### To create an iOS and macOS custom profile  
  
1.  On the **Configure iOS and macOS custom profile settings** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Custom configuration profile name (displayed to users)** - Provide a name for the policy as it will be displayed on the device, and in Configuration Manager reports.  
  
    -   **Import** - Choose a file that you exported from the Apple Configurator tool.  
  
    -   **Configuration profile details** - Displays the file that you imported.  
  
    -   **Remediate noncompliant settings** -  
  
         Select if you want to remediate noncompliant configuration settings (when supported).  
  
    -   **Noncompliance severity for reports** - Specify the severity level that is reported if this compliance policy is evaluated as noncompliant. The available severity levels are the following:  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  When a macOS device is in Sleep mode, policies and profiles cannot be delivered or inventoried. As a result, the Configuration Manager console might temporarily display the status Policy settings in error until the next time the device wakes from Sleep mode.  
  
        -   **None** Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
        -   **Information** Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
        -   **Warning** Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
        -   **Critical** Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports.  
  
        -   **Critical with event** Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. This severity level is also be logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  
  
#### How to create a configuration profile file  
 You can create the configuration profile file used by the custom policy in two ways:  
  
-   Export the file (with the extension **.mobileconfig**) from the Apple Configurator tool.  
  
-   Author the file yourself using the appropriate schema from the [Apple Configuration Profile Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html).  
  
###  Kiosk mode (iOS)  
 Kiosk mode allows you to lock a device to only allow certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to only run one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device, or a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, such as a point of sale device.  
  
#### To configure kiosk mode for iOS devices  
  
1. On the **Configure Kiosk Mode Settings for iOS Devices** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
   - **Select App** - Select the app that will be allowed to run when the device is in kiosk mode. No other apps will be allowed to run on the device. Choose from:
