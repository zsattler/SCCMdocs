# Import Configuration Manager data to Microsoft Intune 

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*    

The recommended first phase in the process to [migrate hybrid MDM users and devices to Intune standalone](migrate-hybridmdm-to-intunesa.md) in the cloud-only configuration is to use the Intune Data Importer tool. If you want, you can skip this phase and move on to the [prepare Intune for user migration](migrate-prepare-intune.md) phase. However, this tool performs the following functions that can save you a lot of time in the next phase:  

1. Collects data about the objects you select from your Configuration Manager hierarchy.  

2. Provides details about the objects you can select for import and information about why some objects cannot be imported.  

3. Imports selected objects into your Microsoft Intune tenant.  

The Data Importer tool doesn't change your Configuration Manager environment in any way. You can import objects into Intune and validate that everything works as expected without risk of leaving your hybrid MDM devices in an unmanaged state. 


## What objects can this tool import?

The import tool can collect information about the following object types in Configuration Manager and provides information about whether the collected objects can be imported:  

- Configuration items  
- Certificate profiles  
- Email profiles  
- VPN profiles  
- Wi-Fi profiles  
- Compliance policies  
- Apps  
- Deployments  

> [!Note]  
> Importing deployments is only useful for other object types you are importing. For example, if you import VPN profiles and deployments, you will only be able to import the deployments for the VPN profiles that you select. Deployments in Intune are called assignments. If you want to import a deployment for a previously imported object, you will need to import that object again or manually create the assignment in Intune on Azure. For example, if you import VPN profiles and not deployments, you will have run the tool again and select VPN profiles and Deployments or manually create the assignment in Intune on Azure. If you rerun the tool, duplicate objects may be created that you can delete later in Intune on Azure.  

> [!Important]  
> If the collection for a deployment is based on an Active Directory group that has been replicated to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the tool automatically targets migrated objects to the groups if you select the appropriate deployment when running the tool. When you have more complex collections or direct membership collections, you must manually recreate them in Azure AD and manually target object assignments to them in Intune on Azure.  


## Things to know before you run the tool

- Running the tool won't change your Configuration Manager environment in any way.  

- First test the data import process using a trial tenant. After you confirm that the data you expect has been imported, you can go through the same process with your production Intune tenant.  

- The data importer is meant to only import Configuration Manager data one time. It doesn't keep track of objects in Configuration Manager or Intune. However, if you run the importer again on the same computer as before, it tells you which objects you previously imported. The tool doesn't know if the object still exists in Intune or if an object has changed. If you import data to Intune more than once, you may end up with duplicate objects.  

- Not all profile settings can be imported. For example, you can't import kiosk mode or PFX settings.  

- If you have a Configuration Manager policy with settings that aren't applicable to the selected platforms, the tool might ignore these settings during the import. Ignoring the settings help to make sure the policy can be imported and supported by Intune.  

- The tool attempts to give you a reason for why an object can't be imported. In some cases, before you import objects to Intune, you can go back to the Configuration Manager console, fix the issue, start the Configuration Manager object discovery scan again, and then import the objects. Sometimes you may need, or may want, to recreate these objects manually in Intune.  

- There are some profiles that depend on other objects. If you want to import a profile that depends on another object, like an email profile that depends on a certificate, you must import both objects at the same time unless you have previously imported the other object from the same computer with the same user.  

- After you run the tool, you might need to perform additional manual steps. For example, targeting apps and policies to Azure AD groups.  

- If any web apps (sometimes called webclips) have been assigned to users, you should remove those web apps before migrating your users. Then reassign the web apps once the migration is complete. If you don't do this action, the web clips will become unmanageable after the migration.  


## Prerequisites

- Specify the top-level site and run the tool with a user that has access to all objects in the site hierarchy. The tool only discovers objects accessible by the user running the tool.  

- A Global Administrator must run the Data Importer tool the first time using the -GlobalConsent parameter. Then a Global Administrator or an Intune Administrator can run the tool. 

- Run the Data Importer tool on Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.


<!-- ## Objects that cannot be imported
There are some Configuration Manager objects that the importer tool cannot import to Intune. You must manually create these objects in Intune. 
- Collections based on direct membership or that are based on a query. The only collections that are imported are based on a single AD group. For all other collections, you must create the assignment in Intune and add the assignment to the appropriate objects. 
- Profiles <list what we cannot import>
- Policies <??>
- Etc.
-->



## Download the Data Importer tool

Download the Data Importer tool from the **ConfigMgrTools/Intune-Data-Importer** repository in GitHub. Use the following procedure to download the tool.

1. Go to the [Intune Data Importer GitHub releases](https://github.com/ConfigMgrTools/Intune-Data-Importer/releases) page.  

2. For the latest release, click **Microsoft.Intune.Data.Importer.exe**.  

3. Save and run the executable file. Then choose a destination folder to extract the Intune Data Importer tool.  



## Run the Data Importer tool

The wizard for the Data Importer tool can be divided in three main steps. This section provides information to help you complete each section of the wizard and successfully import Configuration Manager data into Intune. Each step continues where the previous step ended.


### Provide permission for the Data Importer tool to access resources

Before you can run the Data Importer tool, you must use a Global Administrator account to give the Data Importer tool permission in Azure to access resources. Then you can run the tool by using a Global Administrator or Intune Administrator account.   

1. A Global Administrator must run the tool the first time using the following parameter: `IntuneDataImporter.exe -GlobalConsent`  

2. When the tool starts, sign in using an account with the Global Administrator role in Azure.  

3. Select **Accept** to create an application in Azure with appropriate rights in Microsoft Graph. The Data Importer tool needs these rights to import objects into Microsoft Intune.  

    > [!Important]  
    > When you accept this prompt, you give the tool permission to do the following actions:  
    > - Read all groups  
    > - Sign in and read the user profile  
    > - Read and write Intune device configuration and policies  
    > - Read and write Intune apps  
    > - Read and write Intune role-based administration control policies  
    > - Read and write Intune devices  
    > - Read and write Intune configuration  

4. After you accept consent, any other Global Administrator or Intune Administrator can run the tool to import data from Configuration Manager into Intune on Azure.  

> [!Note]  
> If a Global Administrator hasn't first accepted consent, the tool might display the following error for an Intune Administrator: **You can't access this application**.  


### Manually map collections to Azure AD groups

When you run the Data Importer tool, it extracts the Active Directory group name from collections with a single rule that targets a single Active Directory group. When the assignments are created in Intune, the Data Importer looks for an Azure AD group with the same name as the Active Directory group. If it exists, the tool assigns the imported object to that Azure AD group. 

You can override the Active Directory group name that the Data Importer finds for a collection and provide one or more Azure AD groups to use for that collection. Using the collection mapping file provides a way for you to map collections that are typically not importable with the Data Importer to Azure AD groups. 

#### Find the collections that can't be imported
You can get a list of all collections that arenâ€™t importable so you can add them to your collection mapping .csv file. 

1. Run the Data Importer tool and select the objects to import. Use the procedures in [Phase 1: Discover Configuration Manager objects and collect data](#phase-1-discover-configuration-manager-objects-and-collect-data) and [Phase 2: Resolve issues and select the objects to import](#phase-2-resolve-issues-and-select-the-objects-to-import) to discover and choose the objects. Then, on the **Summary** page, choose **Export Details** to create a .csv file with details of everything selected for import, including the objects that can't be imported and deployments.  

2. Open the .csv file in Microsoft Excel and filter the data based on the **Deployment** for the **Type** column and **No** for the **Importable** column. The collection name column shows all the collections that need to be added to a collection mapping file in order for those deployments to be importable.  

#### Create the collection mapping file
The collection mapping file is a comma-separated values (CSV) file where the first column is the Configuration Manager collection name and the second column is the Azure AD group name to use for that collection. To specify more than one Azure AD group for a single Configuration Manager collection, create multiple rows in the CSV file with that collection name. The following example is a CSV file that contains two collections. The first collection is mapped to a single Azure AD group and the second collection is mapped to two Azure AD groups.

![Example of collection mapping csv file](../media/migrate-collectionmapping.png)

#### Start the Data Importer tool using collection mapping
To use a collection mapping file, you must start the Data Importer tool using the **-CollectionMappingFile** command-line parameter and full path to the collection mapping .csv file you create. For example:

```IntuneDataImporter.exe -CollectionMappingFile c:\Users\myuser\Documents\collectionmapping.csv```

> [!Note]  
> The Data Importer doesn't display anything on any wizard page to indicate that the collection mapping file was loaded. However, the tool displays any errors encountered while reading the .csv file. 
> 
> Also, on the **Summary** page of the wizard you can review **Deployment** types. The tool displays **Yes** in the Importable column and lists the Azure AD groups that it will assign to objects in the **Notes** column.  


### Phase 1: Discover Configuration Manager objects and collect data

In phase 1, you select the objects to discover and have the tool collect information about the selected objects. 

1. Open the tool and select **Start**.  

2. Read the information, and then select **Next**.  

3. Choose whether to import a previously exported data set or select the object types to import:  

    - **Import data set exported from a previous run of Intune Data Importer**: Select **Browse** for **Exported data folder**. Select a data set that you previously exported using the Data Importer Tool. The user who imports the data set must be the same user that exported the data. After you import the data, a summary of the objects are listed on the **Summary** page of the wizard. If the summary looks correct, skip to the [Phase 3: Import selected object to Intune](#phase-3-import-selected-objects-to-intune).  

        > [!Note]  
        > After you discover and select the objects in your site to import, you can export the objects to a data set on the **Sign-in to Intune** page of the wizard. You can then import the data set on this page. The data set is encrypted using the Windows user credentials of the signed-in user so only the user that exported the data set can import the data set in the tool.  

    - **Select object types to import**: Provide the following information about your site and the objects you want to import:  

        - **Site server name**: Provide the fully qualified domain name of the site server to import objects. The tool only discovers objects accessible by the user running the tool. Typically, you will specify the top-level site and run the tool with a user that has access to all objects in the site hierarchy.  

        - **Site code**: Provide the site code for the site server. You can find the three-letter code at the top of the Configuration Manager console.  

        - **Object types to import**: Choose the objects that you want the tool to collect. You can choose **Select all** to choose all the objects or select individual object types.  

4. Select **Next** to start discovering the objects at the site. The tool displays progress for each of the object types.  

    - When the tool discovers no data for a selected object type, the progress bar immediately displays completed for that object type.  

    - Objects that you didn't select don't display on the **Collect** data page.  

    - You can run the tool again for objects that weren't collected or that you cancelled during the collection process.  


### Phase 2: Resolve issues and select the objects to import  

In phase 2, you review the objects found by the tool, resolve issues that prevent the object from being imported to Intune, and select the objects to import. If you fix issues, return to the **Discover environment** page of the wizard to rediscover the objects. 

1. Click **Next** to review the collected objects. An item selection page is available for each collected object type.  
   <!--   > [!Tip]     
   > On each item selection page, you can create a filter to help you find the objects that you want to import. However, take note of the following:
   > - When you are on an item selection page and the view is filtered, the Select all checkboxes only apply to the displayed items. Any hidden objects because of a filter are not included when using the checkboxes.
   > - Objects are always grouped under their parent item even when you sort or filter the objects.
   -->
2. On each item selection page, sort the objects by the **Importable** column and review the objects that aren't importable. The information in the **Notes** column provides details about why the tool can't import the object.  

3. Decide whether you want to fix any of the issues for non-importable objects. If you fix one or more issues, select **Previous** until you get to the Select data from Configuration Manager page. Then collect the data again to see if you resolved the issue. You can continue to fix issues until you're satisfied with the objects that are importable.  

4. On each item selection page, select the objects that you want to import. The following columns are listed:  

    - **Name**: Name of the Configuration Manager object.  

    - **Importable**: Specifies whether an object can be imported. You can only choose objects that have Yes in the Importable column.  

    - **Platform**: Specifies the platform supported by the object.  

    - **Already imported**: Specifies whether the object has already been imported by using the tool on this computer.  

    - **Is superseded** (for apps): Specifies whether the app is superseded by another app. Select the **Show superseded apps** option at the top of the page for superseded apps to display.  

    - **Notes**: Provides information about why an object canâ€™t be imported. The **Notes** column also displays information about settings that were ignored (for some object types), but the object is still importable without those settings.  

    - **Configuration baselines** (for configuration items): Specifies the configuration baselines that are associated with a configuration item.  

    - **Required certificate** (for profiles and policies): Specifies whether a certificate is associated with the object. When a certificate is associated with the object, you must import the certificate too.  

5. After you choose the objects to import, they're listed on the Summary page. You have the following actions available:  

    - **Export details**: Creates a .csv file that contains the information displayed on the screen. It also shows objects that aren't importable and the reason why it can't be imported. You can keep this file for your records.  

    - **Export error data**: Exports a compressed file that contains information about the data that the tool wasnâ€™t able convert or import.  


### Phase 3: Import selected objects to Intune

In phase 3, you sign into Intune and import the selected objects. 

1. Select **Next**, and then select one of the following options:  

    - **Export**: After you discover and select the objects in your site to import, you can export the objects to a data set. This allows you to discover objects from a computer that doesn't have internet access, export the data, and then import the data from a computer that has internet access. The data set is encrypted using the Windows user credentials of the signed-in user so only the user that exported the data set can import the data set in the tool. When you choose this option, choose the path to the exported data.  

        1. Select **Export** on the **Sign in to Intune** page.  

        2. Select **Browse** to select the destination folder for the export. The folder must be empty.  

        3. Select **Start** to export the data. When the export completes, select **Close** to complete the wizard and close the Data Importer.  

        4. Start the Data Importer from another computer with internet access using the same credentials. Select **Import previously exported data set** on the second page of the wizard. Once the data is imported, the wizard takes you to the **Sign in to Intune** page.  

    - **Sign in to Intune**: Sign in with a Global Administrator or Intune Administrator account. After you sign in, the import process starts.  

        > [!Important]  
        > First test the data import process using a trial tenant. After you confirm that the data you expect has been imported, you can go through the same process with your production Intune tenant.  

2. The Progress page provides the progress as the objects are imported. Click **Next** when the import completes.  

3. On the Completion page, the imported objects are listed. Check the status for any objects that encountered an error during the import process. You have the following actions available:  

    - **Export details**: Creates a .csv file that contains the information displayed on screen. You can keep this file for your records.  

    - **Export error data**: Exports a compressed file that contains information about the data that the tool wasnâ€™t able convert or import.  



## Next steps

After you import the data into Intune, [prepare Intune for user migration](migrate-prepare-intune.md).
