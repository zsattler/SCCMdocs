# Software inventory for mobile devices enrolled with Microsoft Intune

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

 You can collect inventory for apps installed on mobile devices. The apps that are inventoried will depend on whether the device is company-owned or personal-owned. For personal devices, the only apps that are inventoried are apps that are managed by Microsoft Intune.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Inventory on the apps installed on mobile devices is collected as part of the [hardware inventory](mobile-device-hardware-inventory-hybrid.md) process.  

 Here are the apps that are inventoried for personal-owned or company-owned devices.  

|Platform|For Personal-owned Devices|For Company-owned devices|
