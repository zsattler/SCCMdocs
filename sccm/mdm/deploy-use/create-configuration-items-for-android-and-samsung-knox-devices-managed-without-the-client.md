# How to create configuration items for Android and Samsung KNOX devices managed without the System Center Configuration Manager client

Use the System Center Configuration Manager **Android and Samsung KNOX** configuration item to manage settings for Android and Samsung KNOX devices that are enrolled in Microsoft Intune or managed on-premises by Configuration Manager.  

## Create an Android and Samsung KNOX configuration item  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Assets and compliance**.  

2. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then choose **Configuration Items**.  

3. On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, choose **Create Configuration Item**.  

4. On the **General** page of the Create Configuration Item Wizard, specify a name and an optional description for the configuration item.  

5. Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, choose **Android and Samsung KNOX**.  

6. Choose **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the Configuration Manager console.  

7. On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, choose the specific Android or Samsung KNOX platforms that will evaluate the configuration item.  

8. On the **Device Settings** page of the wizard, choose the setting group that you want to configure. See [Android and Samsung KNOX configuration item settings reference](#android-and-samsung-knox-configuration-item-settings-reference) in this topic for details, and then choose **Next**.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  If the setting that you want is not listed, check the **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups** box.  

9. On each settings page, configure the settings that you require. Also, choose whether you want to remediate them when they are not compliant on devices (when this is supported).  

10. For each setting group, you can also configure the severity that will be reported when a configuration item is found to be noncompliant:  

    - **None**. Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.  

    - **Information**. Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    - **Warning**. Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    - **Critical**. Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    - **Critical with event**. Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. This severity level is also logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  

11. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that are not compatible with the supported platforms you chose earlier. You can go back and remove these settings, or you can continue.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  Unsupported settings are not assessed for compliance.  

12. Finish the wizard.  

    You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.

## Android for Work configuration items
Android for Work has two setting groups for configuration items:

- **Password**. Identical to settings for Android "classic."

- **Work Profile**. Enables the following Android for Work settings:
  - **Allow data sharing between work and personal profiles**
  - **Hide work profile notifications when device is locked** (Android 6.0+)
  - **Set up default app permission policy** (Android 6.0+)

To create a configuration item in the Android work profile, choose **Android for Work** on the **General** page and configure settings for each of the setting groups. Add the configuration item to a baseline, and deploy as usual. These settings will apply only to devices enrolled as Android for Work, and not to devices enrolled as Android.

### Kiosk mode (Samsung KNOX only)  
You can use kiosk mode to lock a device to allow only certain features to work. For example, you can allow a device to run only one managed app that you specify, or you can disable the volume buttons on a device. These settings might be used for a demonstration model of a device. Or they might be used for a device that is dedicated to performing only one function, like a point-of-sale device.  

#### To configure kiosk mode for a Samsung KNOX device  

1. On the **Configure Kiosk Mode Settings for Samsung KNOX Devices** page of the Create Configuration Item Wizard, specify the following information:  

   |Setting|More information|  
   |-------------|----------------------|  
   |**Select app**|Choose **Browse** to select a Configuration Manager Android application (with the extension **.apk**) that will be allowed to run when the device is in kiosk mode. No other apps will be allowed to run on the device.|  
   |**Volume buttons**|Enables or disables the use of the volume buttons on the device.|  
   |**Screen sleep and wake button**|Enables or disables the screen sleep wake button on the device.|  

2. When you are finished, choose **Next**.  

## Reports for monitoring
You can use one of the following reports to monitor compliant and noncompliant apps:  

- **List of noncompliant Apps and Devices for a specified user**. Shows information about users and devices that have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  

- **Summary of Users who have Noncompliant Apps**. Shows information about users who have apps installed that are not compliant with a policy you specified.  

For information about how to use reports, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/manage/reporting.md).
