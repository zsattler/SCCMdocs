# How to create configuration items for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 devices managed without the System Center Configuration Manager client


 Use the System Center Configuration Manager**Windows 8.1 and Windows 10** configuration item to manage settings  for Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 devices that are enrolled in Microsoft Intune or managed on-premises by Configuration Manager.  

## Create a Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 configuration item  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, click **Assets and compliance**.  

2. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then click **Configuration Items**.  

3. On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Configuration Item**.  

4. On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.  

5. Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, select **Windows 8.1 and Windows 10**.  

6. Click **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the Configuration Manager console.  

7. On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, select the specific Windows platforms that evaluate the configuration item.  

8. On the **Device Settings** page of the wizard, select the settings group that you want to configure. See [Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 configuration item settings reference](#windows-81-and-windows-10-configuration-item-settings-reference) in this topic for details, and then click **Next**.  

   > [!TIP]  
   >  If the setting that you want is not listed, select the **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups check box**.  

9. On each settings page, configure the settings you require, and whether you want to remediate them when they are not compliant on devices (when this is supported).  

10. For each settings group, you can also configure the severity that is reported when a configuration item is found to be noncompliant from:  

    -   **None** - Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for Configuration Manager reports.  

    -   **Information** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    -   **Warning** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    -   **Critical** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports.  

    -   **Critical with event** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for Configuration Manager reports. This severity level is also be logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  

11. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that are not compatible with the supported platforms you selected earlier. You can go back and remove these settings, or you can continue.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  Unsupported settings are not assessed for compliance.  

12. Complete the wizard.  

    You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.

### Windows Information Protection  

With the increase of employee-owned devices in the enterprise, there’s also an increasing risk of accidental data leaks through apps and services, like email, social media, and the public cloud, which are outside of the enterprise’s control. For example, when an employee sends the latest engineering pictures from their personal email account, copies and pastes product info into a tweet, or saves an in-progress sales report to their public cloud storage.

Windows Information Protection (WIP) helps to protect against this potential data leakage without otherwise interfering with the employee experience. WIP also helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leaks on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps.

 Configuration Manager WIP configuration item settings manage the list of apps protected by EDP, enterprise network locations, protection level, and encryption settings.

For information about how to configure enterprise data protection with Configuration Manager, see [Protect your enterprise data using Windows Information Protection (WIP)](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/keep-secure/protect-enterprise-data-using-wip).
