# Protect data with remote wipe, lock, or passcode reset by using Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Configuration Manager provides selective wipe, full wipe, remote lock, and passcode reset capabilities. Mobile devices can store sensitive corporate data and provide access to many corporate resources. To help protect devices, you can issue:  

- A full wipe to restore the device to its factory settings  

- A selective wipe to remove only company data  

- A remote lock to help secure a device that might be lost  

- A reset of the device passcode  

> [!Important]  
> As of August 14, 2018, hybrid mobile device management is a [deprecated feature](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures). For more information, see [What is hybrid MDM](/sccm/mdm/understand/hybrid-mobile-device-management).<!--Intune feature 2683117-->  



## Full wipe  

You might issue a wipe command to a device when you need to secure a lost device or when you retire a device from active use.  

Issue a **full wipe** to a device to restore the device to its factory defaults. This removes all company and user data and settings. You can do a full wipe on Windows Phone, iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices.  

> [!NOTE]
> You can only perform a full wipe on company-owned devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Wiping Windows 10 devices on versions earlier than version 1511 with less than 4 GB of RAM might leave the device unresponsive. [Learn more](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt592024.aspx#full-wipe-disables-windows-10-devices-with-less-than-4-gb-ram).

#### To initiate a remote wipe from the Configuration Manager console  

1. In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Assets and Compliance** and choose **Devices**. Alternatively, you can choose **Device Collections** and select a collection.  

2. Select the device that you want to retire/wipe.  

3. Choose **Remote Device Actions** in **Device Group**, and then choose **Retire/Wipe**.  



## Selective wipe  

Issue a **selective wipe** to a device to remove only company data. The following table describes, by platform, what data is removed and the effect on data that remains on the device after a selective wipe.  

**iOS**  

|Content removed when you're retiring a device|iOS|  
|--------------------------------------------|---------|  
|Company apps and associated data installed by using Configuration Manager and Intune|Apps are uninstalled. Company app data is removed.|

## Wiping EFS-enabled content  

Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1 support selective wipe of Encrypting File System (EFS)-encrypted content. The following apply to a selective wipe of EFS-enabled content:  

- Only apps and data that are protected by EFS through the same Internet domain as the Intune account are selectively wiped. For more information, see [Windows Selective Wipe for Device Data Management](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn486874.aspx).  

- If any changes are made to the domain associated with EFS, the changes can take up to 48 hours before apps and data that use the new domain can be selectively wiped.  

- Each domain that is registered with Intune is the domain that will be wiped.  

The data and apps that EFS selective wipe currently supports are:  

- Mail app for Windows.  

- Work folders.

- Files and folders encrypted by EFS. For more information, see [Best practices for the Encrypting File System](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/223316).  


### Best practices for selective wipe  

- For a successful wipe of email, set up email profiles to iOS and Windows Phone 8.1 devices.  

- For a successful wipe of apps, make sure the apps are distributed through mobile device app management.  

- For iOS, configure the setting **Allow backup to iCloud** to **Disallow** so that users can’t restore content by using iCloud.  

- If an account has been deactivated, then after one year, Intune will retire the account and a selective wipe will be done.  



##  Passcode reset  

If a user forgets their passcode, you can help them by removing the passcode from a device or by forcing a new temporary passcode on a device. The following table lists how passcode reset works on different mobile platforms.  

| Platform                              | Passcode reset                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iOS                                   | Supported for clearing the passcode from a device. Does not create a new temporary passcode. |
