# Past hybrid features with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

This article provides details on the past mobile device management (MDM) features available for hybrid deployments with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.  

##  Compatibility with Configuration Manager versions  

 Each section of this article lists hybrid features under 3 different categories. Use the following guidance to determine compatibility of the features in each category  with different versions of Configuration Manager:  

|Feature categories|
|-|  
|**New in Microsoft Intune** - In general, all the features listed under this category should work with all Configuration Manager releases including System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager releases, since these features only require the  Intune service and do not require additional functionality in  Configuration Manager.<br /><br /> **New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview** - All the features listed under this category only work with the specified Technical Preview release. To try out these features, you must install the Technical Preview version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/get-started/technical-preview.md).<br /><br /> **New in Configuration Manager (current branch)** - All the features listed under this category only work with the specified version of Configuration Manager (current branch), such as version 1511 or 1602. If you're using an older version of Configuration Manager for your hybrid deployment, you must upgrade to the Configuration Manager (current branch)  version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Upgrade to System Center Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/deploy/install/upgrade-to-configuration-manager.md).|  



## April 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **MyApps available for Managed Browser**  
  Microsoft MyApps now have better support within the Managed Browser. Managed Browser users who aren't targeted for management are brought directly to the MyApps service, where they can access their admin-provisioned SaaS apps. Users who are targeted for Intune management continue to access MyApps from the built-in Managed Browser bookmark.

- **New icons for the Managed Browser and the Company Portal**  
  The Managed Browser is receiving updated icons for both the Android and iOS versions of the app. The new icon contains the updated Intune badge to make it more consistent with other apps in Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S). You can see the new icon for the Managed Browser on the [what's new in Intune app UI page](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

  The Company Portal is also receiving updated icons for the Android, iOS, and Windows versions of the app to improve consistency with other apps in EM+S. These icons are gradually released across platforms from April to late May.

- **Sign-in progress indicator in Android Company Portal**  
  An update to the Android Company Portal app shows a sign-in progress indicator when the user launches or resumes the app. The indicator progresses through new statuses, beginning with "Connecting...", then "Signing in...", then "Checking for security requirements..." before allowing the user to access the app. You can see the new screens for the Company Portal app for Android on the [what's new in Intune app UI page](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

- **Block apps from accessing SharePoint Online**  
  You can now create an app-based conditional access policy to block apps, which don't have app protection policies applied to them, from accessing [SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-classic/deploy-use/mam-ca-for-sharepoint-online). In the apps-based conditional access scenario, you can specify the apps that you want to have access to SharePoint Online using the Azure portal.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1704

- **Configure Android apps with app configuration policies**  
  When a user runs an app on Android for Work devices, use app configuration policies in Configuration Manager to distribute pre-configured settings. Android app configuration policies are available only on devices running Android for Work. These policies apply to approved apps from the Play for Work store. For more information, see [Configure Android apps with app configuration policies](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1704#configure-android-apps-with-app-configuration-policies).



## March 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **New user experience for the Company Portal app for Android**  
  The Company Portal app for Android has a more modern look and feel to its user interface. The notable updates are:

  - Colors: Company Portal tab headers are colored in IT-defined branding.
  - Apps: In the **Apps** tab, the **Featured Apps** and **All Apps** buttons are updated.
  - Search: In the **Apps** tab, the **Search** button is a floating action button.
  - Navigating Apps: **All Apps** view shows a tabbed view of **Featured**, **All**, and **Categories** for easier navigation.
  - Support: **My Devices** and **Contact IT** tabs are updated to improve readability.

  For more information about these changes, see [UI updates for Intune end-user apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

- **Signing Script for Windows 10 Company Portal**  
  If you need to download and sideload the Windows 10 Company Portal app, you can now use a script to simplify and streamline the app-signing process for your organization. To download the script and the instructions for using it, see  [Microsoft Intune Signing Script for Windows 10 Company Portal](https://aka.ms/win10cpscript) on TechNet Gallery. For more information about this announcement, see [Updating your Windows 10 Company Portal app](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/intunesupport/2017/03/13/updating-your-windows-10-company-portal-app/) on the Intune Support Team Blog.

- **Improved support for Android users based in China**  
  Due to the absence of the Google Play Store in China, Android devices must obtain apps from Chinese marketplaces. The Company Portal supports this workflow. It redirects Android users in China to download the Company Portal and Outlook apps from local app stores. This behavior improves the user experience when Conditional Access policies are enabled, both for Mobile Device Management and for Mobile Application Management. The Company Portal and Outlook apps for Android are available on the following Chinese app stores:

  - [Baidu](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836946)
  - [Xiaomi](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836947)
  - [Tencent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836949)
  - [Huawei](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836948)
  - [Wandoujia](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836950)

- **Make sure your Company Portal apps are up-to-date**  
  In December 2016, we released an update that enabled enforcement for multi-factor authentication (MFA) on a group of users when they enroll an iOS, Android, Windows 8.1+, or Windows Phone 8.1+ device. This feature can't work without certain baseline versions of the Company Portal app for Android (v5.0.3419.0+) and iOS (v2.1.17+).

  Intune's management capabilities are continuously improving. Many improvements have coordinated updates to the Company Portal apps on all supported platforms. We recommend you keep the latest versions of the Company Portal apps on installed on devices. This practice takes advantage of improvements in Intune and for the best user experience.

  >[!Tip]
  > Have your users set their devices to automatically update apps from the appropriate app store. If you have made the Android Company Portal app available on a network share, you can download the latest version from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49140).

- **Microsoft Teams is now enabled for MAM on iOS and Android**  
  The Microsoft Teams apps for iOS and Android are now enabled with Intune mobile app management (MAM) capabilities. Empower your teams to work freely across devices, while ensuring that conversations and corporate data are protected. For more information, see [the Microsoft Teams announcement](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/03/14/microsoft-teams-is-now-generally-available-and-mam-enabled-on-ios-and-android/) on the Enterprise Mobility and Security blog.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1703

- **Additional support for Apple Volume Purchase Program scenarios**  
   Beginning in Technical Preview 1703, you now have support for the following Volume Purchase Program (VPP) scenarios:

   - Device licensing - Apps that support device licensing and are deployed to device collections now only require one license per device. Previously, you had to use a license for each user on a device. For more information, see [Deploy volume-purchased iOS apps to device collections](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1703#deploy-volume-purchased-ios-apps-to-device-collections).
   - Use of multiple VPP tokens to a single hybrid tenant with both tokens used for managing VPP apps.
   - Use of VPP education tokens with the ability to distinguish between business and education tokens.

### New in Configuration Manager (current branch)

The following features were previously available in Configuration Manager Technical Preview releases. These features are now available in hybrid deployments with Intune and Configuration Manager (current branch) version 1702.

## February 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Modernizing the Company Portal website**

  The Company Portal website supports apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website aligns with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," which contains helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page is rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps. You can find before-and-after images available on the [UI updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui) page.

- **New MDM server address for Windows devices**

  The MDM server address for enrolling Windows and Windows Phone devices has changed from manage.microsoft.com to enrollment.manage.microsoft.com. Notify your user to use enrollment.manage.microsoft.com as the MDM server address if prompted for it while enrolling a Windows or and Windows Phone device. This update also requires any CNAME in DNS that redirects EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com to manage.microsoft.com to be replaced with a CNAME in DNS that redirects EnterpriseEnrollment.contoso.com to EnterpriseEnrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com. For additional information about this change, visit https://aka.ms/intuneenrollsvrchange.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1702

- **Android for Work Support**

  You can now manage Android devices using Android for Work in hybrid MDM environments using Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1702. Supported Android devices can now be enrolled as Android for Work devices, which creates a work profile on the device to which apps approved in Play for Work can be deployed. You can also configure and deploy configuration items, compliance policies, and resource access profiles for these devices. For more information, see [Android for Work support](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#android-for-work-support).

- **Non-Compliant Apps Compliance Settings**

  You can now create non-compliant apps rules for Android and iOS apps in compliance policies. If devices have the specified applications installed, they are marked “non-compliant” and lose access to company resources according to conditional access policies in place. For more information, see [Conditional access device compliance policy improvements](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#conditional-access-device-compliance-policy-improvements).

- **PFX Certificate Creation and Distribution and S/MIME Support**

  You can now create and deploy PFX certificates to users in a hybrid environment. These certificates can then be used for S/MIME email encryption and decryption by devices that the user has enrolled. For more information, see [Create PFX certificates with S MIME support](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#create-pfx-certificates-with-s-mime-support).

- **Support for additional iOS configuration settings**
   
    You now have 42 additional iOS settings that you can configure as part of a configuration item. Most of the settings (35 in all) have been added for supervised iOS devices. For more information, see  [New compliance settings for iOS devices](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1702#new-compliance-settings-for-ios-devices).



## January 2017

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Android 7.1.1 support**

  Intune now fully supports and manages Android 7.1.1.

- **Resolve issue where iOS devices are inactive, or the admin console cannot communicate with them**

  When users’ devices lose contact with Intune, you can give them new troubleshooting steps to help them regain access to company resources. See [Devices are inactive, or the admin console cannot communicate with them](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-device-enrollment-in-intune#devices-are-inactive-or-the-admin-console-cant-communicate-with-them).

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1701

- **Android and iOS versions are no longer targetable in creation wizards for hybrid MDM**

  Beginning in Technical Preview 1701 for hybrid mobile device management (MDM), you no longer need to target specific versions of Android and iOS when creating new policies and profiles for Intune-managed devices. With this change, hybrid deployments can provide support more quickly for new Android and iOS versions without needing a new Configuration Manager release or extension. To learn more, see [Android and iOS versions are no longer targetable in creation wizards](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1701#android-and-ios-versions-are-no-longer-targetable-in-creation-wizards-for-hybrid-mdm).



## December 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) on enrollment is moving to the Azure portal**

  Previously, you would go to either the Intune console or the Configuration Manager console to set MFA for Intune enrollments. With this updated feature, you now login to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) using your Intune credentials and configure MFA settings through Azure AD. To learn more, see [Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft Intune](https://aka.ms/mfa_ad).

- **Company Portal app for Android now available in China**

  The Company Portal app for Android is now available in China. Due to the absence of Google Play Store in China, Android devices must obtain apps from Chinese app marketplaces. The Company Portal app for Android is available for download on the following stores:

  - [Baidu](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836946)
  - [Huawei](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836948)
  - [Tencent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836949)
  - [Wandoujia](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836950)
  - [Xiaomi](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836947)

  The Company Portal app for Android uses Google Play Services to communicate with the Microsoft Intune service. Since Google Play Services are not yet available in China, performing any of the following tasks can take up to 8 hours to complete.

  | Configuration Manager Admin Console | Intune Company Portal app for Android | Intune Company Portal Website |
  |----|----|----|
  | Retire/wipe (remove all data)| Remove a remote device | Remove device (local and remote) |
  | Retire/wipe (remove company data)| Reset device | Reset device|
  | New or updated app deployments | Install available line-of-business apps | Device passcode reset|
  | Remote lock| | |
  | Passcode reset | | |


## November 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

- **New Microsoft Intune Company Portal available for Windows 10 devices**

  Microsoft has released a new [Company Portal app for Windows 10 devices](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj3pz). This app, which leverages the new Windows 10 Universal format, provides an updated user experience that is identical across all Windows 10 devices, PC and Mobile alike, while still enabling all the same functionality provided by previous Company Portal apps.

  The new app leverages platform features like single sign-on (SSO) and certificate-based authentication on Windows 10 devices. The app is available as an upgrade to the existing Windows 8.1 Company Portal and Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal installs from the Windows Store. For more details, go to the [Intune Support Team Blog](https://aka.ms/intunecp_universalapp).

  The new Company Portal app also displays any Windows Store for Business applications marked **Available** in the Configuration Manager console.

The following additional hybrid features are also included in version 1610 of Configuration Manager (current branch):

- **Increased number of enrolled devices**

  You can now enable users to enroll up to 15 devices. The previous limit was 5 devices per user.


- **Addtional security support**

  In addition to Full Administrator, the following built-in security roles now have full access to items in the All Corporate-owned Devices node, including Predeclared Devices, iOS Enrollment Profiles, and Windows Enrollment Profiles:

    - Asset Manager
    - Company Resource Access Manager

  Read-only access to these areas of the Configuration Manager console is still granted to the Read-only Analyst role.

- **Auto-trigger VPN access from Windows Information Protection apps**

  You can add a Windows Information Protection primary domain to Windows 10 VPN profiles that causes all associated apps to automatically trigger a VPN connection when they are run on the device. This option is only available when choosing a native connection type.

- **Conditional access for Windows 10 VPN profiles**

    You can now require Windows 10 devices enrolled in Azure Active Directory to be compliant in order to have VPN access through Windows 10 VPN profiles created in the Configuration Manager console. This is possible through the new **Enable conditional access for this VPN connection** checkbox on the Authentication Method page in the VPN profile wizard and VPN profile properties for Windows 10 VPN profiles. This option is only available when choosing a native connection type.

    You can also specify a separate certificate for single sign-on authentication if you enable conditional access for the profile.

## October 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

The following Intune features introduced in October 2016 work in hybrid deployments.

- **Conditional access for mobile application management**

  You can restrict access to Exchange Online so that access comes only from apps that support Intune mobile application management policies such as Outlook. [This new feature](/intune/deploy-use/allow-policy-managed-apps-access-to-o365) pairs up perfectly with Intune mobile app management (MAM) policies as you can block access to built-in mail clients or other apps that have not been configured with the Intune MAM policies. This ensures your users are accessing your organization’s data with apps that can be protected using Intune MAM. You can get started in Intune mobile app management via the Azure portal. Look for the new Conditional Access section in the “Settings” blade.

- **Intune App Wrapping Tool for Android**

  You can enable your apps to use Intune mobile application management (MAM) policies by using the Intune App Wrapping Tool.

- **Android Samsung KNOX Standard compatibility with Intune**

  Certain models of the Samsung Galaxy Ace phone cannot be managed by Intune as Samsung KNOX Standard devices. When you enroll these devices with Intune, they will instead be managed as standard Android devices.

  The model numbers affected are:

  - SM-G313HU
  - SM-G313HY
  - SM-G313M
  - SM-G313MY
  - SM-G313U

  You and your end users need take no further action. For more information, visit the Samsung KNOX website.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1610

The following new hybrid features have been introduced in October 2016 for Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1610.

- **Request a policy sync from the admin console**

  You can request a policy sync on an enrolled mobile device from the Configuration Manager console, instead of needing to request the sync in the Company Portal app on the device itself. This is a new action called **Send Sync Request** in the Remote Device Actions menu, which appears in the ribbon when a mobile device is selected in the Devices node.

- **Windows Defender Configuration Settings**

  You can now configure Windows Defender client settings on Intune-enrolled Windows 10 computers using configuration items in the Configuration Manager console. There’s a new setting group called **Windows Defender** in the Configuration Item wizard. Note that this is supported only on Windows 10 Version 1511 and above.


### New in Configuration Manager (current branch)

No new hybrid features have been introduced in August 2016 for Configuration Manager (current branch).

## September 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

The following Intune features introduced in September 2016 work in hybrid deployments.

- **Addition of "Notifications" to the Company Portal for Android**

  A new Notifications icon has been added to the Company Portal for Android on the homepage. Tapping this icon accesses the Notifications page, which shows your end users all items that require attention in the Company Portal app, such as device noncompliance, enrollment update, and enrollment activation. The iOS Company Portal app already has this notifications experience. Having the new Notifications page means that user won’t see the Company Access Setup page every time they launch or resume the Company Portal as long as the device is already enrolled. If you create your own end-user guidance, you might want to update your documentation to reflect this change. Find updated screenshots [here](https://aka.ms/androidcpupdate).

- **Changes in support for the iOS Company Portal app**

  All users of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app for iOS are now required to use its latest version. New users are able to download only the latest version, and current users are required to update to it. The latest version requires iOS 8.0 or later, so devices running older iOS versions cannot use the Company Portal or enroll until they update their device to iOS 8.0 or later, and then update the Company Portal app to the latest version. Enrolled devices running versions below iOS 8.0 will continue to be managed and listed in the Intune Admin Console.

- **Feedback button added to Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal app**

  The Windows Phone 8.1 Company Portal app enables end users to send feedback about the app by using a new "send feedback" button. To find the button, users tap the “three dots” menu at the bottom right of the Company Portal app screen and then tap **send feedback**. The collected, anonymized feedback will help Microsoft improve the Company Portal app experience for users.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1609

The following new hybrid features have been introduced in September 2016 for Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1609.

- **Additional settings and improved experience for Configuration Item settings**

  New settings have been added for Android, iOS, and Windows, and only settings that apply to the platforms you select on the Supported Platforms page are displayed in the wizard.

- **Additional settings for DEP profiles**

  TouchID, ApplePay, and Zoom have been added as configurable settings in DEP profiles for iOS devices.

- **Paid Apps in Windows Store for Business**

  You can now add both paid and free applications to Windows Store for Business and deploy them to users in your organization. For more information see [Enhancements to Windows Store for Business in TP 1609](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1609#enhancements-to-windows-store-for-business-integration-with-configuration-manager).

- **Native connection types for Windows 10 VPN profiles**

  You can now create Windows 10 VPN profiles for MDM with Microsoft Automatic, IKEv2, and PPTP connection types in the Configuration Manager console without using OMA-URI.

- **Intune Compliance Charts**

  You can get a quick view of overall device compliance and top reasons for non-compliance using new charts under the Monitoring workspace. For more information, see [Intune compliance charts in TP 1609](/sccm/core/get-started/capabilities-in-technical-preview-1609#intune-compliance-charts).

### New in Configuration Manager (current branch)

The following new feature introduced in September 2016 is available for hybrid deployments with Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager version 1606 (current branch).

- **iOS 10 support**

  If you have profiles or configuration items targeted to all iOS platforms, these will also be pushed to iOS 10. We’ve also released an update to Configuration Manager version 1606 that allows you to target profiles and configuration items to individual iOS platforms including iOS 10. You can install the update with the Configuration Manager admin console at **Administration > Overview > Cloud Services > Updates and Servicing**. You can find more information about the update at [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3192616](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3192616).

## August 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

The following Intune features introduced in August 2016 work in hybrid deployments.

- **Android 7 support in the Company Portal app**

  The Intune Company Portal app for Android provides “day 0” support for the forthcoming Android 7.0 operating system for mobile devices.

- **Google removal of remote passcode reset capability on Android 7.0 devices**

  Google is removing the ability of IT administrators and end users to remotely reset the passcode of Android 7.0 devices. Previously, IT administrators could remotely reset a user’s passcode, and end users could reset their passcodes from the Company Portal website.

- **Allowed and blocked apps policy for Samsung KNOX Standard devices**

  You can now configure a custom policy for Samsung KNOX Standard devices that lets you create one of the following:

  - A list of apps that are blocked from running on the device. Even if installed, an app defined in the blocked list cannot be activated on the device.
  - A list of apps that users of the device are allowed to install from the Google Play store. No other apps can be installed from the store.

  These settings can only be used by devices that run Samsung KNOX Standard. For details, see [Use custom policies to allow and block apps for Samsung KNOX Standard devices](/intune/deploy-use/custom-policy-to-allow-and-block-samsung-knox-apps).

- **Feedback link from the Company Portal to Microsoft**

   The Company Portal website enables end users to tap a new "Feedback" link, at the bottom of the page, to send feedback to Microsoft about their experience with the site. The collected, anonymized feedback will help Microsoft improve the Company Portal website experience for users.

- **Minimum iOS Managed Browser version updated to 8.0**

  The Microsoft Intune Managed Browser app for iOS has been updated to support devices running iOS 8.0 or later. While iOS 7.1 devices can still use the existing Managed Browser app, encourage your users to update to iOS 8.0 or later to access and take full advantage of new Managed Browser features.

### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview

  The Intune App SDK Xamarin component allows you to enable the Intune mobile app management features in your mobile iOS and Android apps built with Xamarin. You can find the component in the [Xamarin store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/Microsoft.Intune.MAM) or on the [Microsoft Intune Github page](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk).

- **Improved end-user experience when enrolling Windows devices**

  When you are using conditional access, the enrollment steps for Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Desktop, and Windows 10 Mobile have been clarified in the Company Portal website. Users will now see separate **Device enrollment** and **Workplace Join** steps, making it easier for them to see the status of their device and to complete the process if they experience a Workplace Join (WPJ) failure. The separate steps are also expected to simplify the troubleshooting process for IT administrators. Previously, when end users tried to enroll and all enrollment steps succeeded except for WPJ, the enrolled device would not appear on the list of devices for users to identify, causing confusion for users.

  - **Full wipe now available for Windows 10 devices**

    Windows 10 PCs and laptops enrolled as mobile devices can be wiped to reset the device to its factory settings. For more information, see [How to protect your devices with remote wipe](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/wipe-lock-reset-devices).

- **Changes to Device Enrollment Managers accounts in the iOS Company Portal app**

  To improve performance and scale, Intune no longer displays all Device Enrollment Managers (DEM) devices in the My Devices pane of the iOS Company Portal app. Only the local device running the app is displayed, and only if it is enrolled via the Company Portal app.

  The DEM user may perform actions on the local device, but remote management of other enrolled devices can only be performed from the Intune admin console. Additionally, Intune is deprecating use of DEM accounts with either the Apple Device Enrollment Program or the Apple Configurator tool. Both these enrollment methods already support user-less enrollment for shared iOS devices.

  Only use DEM accounts when user-less enrollment for shared devices is unavailable. For more information, see [Enroll corporate-owned devices with the Device Enrollment Manager in Microsoft Intune](../deploy-use/enroll-devices-with-device-enrollment-manager.md).

- **Changes to the Android Company Portal app**

  If Android end users see an error message that says their device is missing a required certificate, they can tap a "How to resolve this" button to get steps for installing the missing certificate. If users complete the steps, but see an additional "missing certificate" error message, they are asked to contact their IT administrator and provide this link, which contains steps that IT administrators can use to fix the certificate issue.

- **Restrict side-loaded app installations to enrolled Android devices**

  Android devices can no longer install applications through the Company Portal website unless the devices have been enrolled in Intune by using the Intune Company Portal app for Android.

## Notices

### System Center 2012 Configuration SP1 and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager (RTM): Support for hybrid mobile device management ending on April 10, 2017
*January 11, 2017*

Support for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 and System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager RTM ended on July 12, 2016. Subsequently, support for these releases connecting to the Microsoft Intune service for hybrid MDM ends on April 10, 2017. After this date, hybrid MDM will stop functioning with these releases. Managed devices will essentially become unmanaged as the Intune Connector will no longer connect to the Intune service. Configuration Manager data (such as policies and applications) will not flow up to Intune and managed device data will not flow down to Configuration Manager until an upgrade takes place.

If you're running a hybrid deployment with Configuration Manager 2012 SP1 or R2 RTM, we recommend that before April 10, 2017 you upgrade to Configuration Manager (current branch) or the latest supported service pack for Configuration Manager 2012 (either R2 SP1 or SP2) to avoid disruption of service.

Additional resources:
- [Upgrade to System Center Configuration Manager (current branch)](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/upgrade-to-configuration-manager)

### Windows Phone 8 Company Portal upload deprecated
*October 25, 2016*

The ability to upload a signed Company Portal app has been removed from the Configuration Manager console, as Intune support is being deprecated for Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows RT, and support for the Windows Phone 8 Company Portal is ending in November.  Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and Windows RT devices that are already enrolled will continue to be supported, but enrolling additional devices with these platforms will not be supported.
