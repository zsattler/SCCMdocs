OneTrace works with many types of log files, such as:

- Configuration Manager client logs
- Configuration Manager server logs
- Status messages
- Windows Update ETW log file on Windows 10
- Windows Update log file on Windows 7 & Windows 8.1

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework version 4.6 or later

## Install

OneTrace installs with Support Center. Find the Support Center installer on the site server at the following path: `cd.latest\SMSSETUP\Tools\SupportCenter\SupportCenterInstaller.msi`.

By default, the OneTrace application is installed at `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Configuration Manager Support Center\CMPowerLogViewer.exe`.
