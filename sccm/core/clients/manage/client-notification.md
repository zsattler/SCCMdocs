# Client notification in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

To take immediate action on remote clients, send a client notification action from the Configuration Manager console. Start these actions on an individual device or on a collection of devices. 



## Actions

The following actions are on the ribbon in the Device or Collection group of the Home tab. 


### Install client

Opens the **Install Client Wizard**. This wizard uses client push installation to install a Configuration Manager client. For more information, see [Client push installation](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers#BKMK_ClientPush).

#### Permissions
This action requires the **Modify Resource** and **Read** permissions on the **Collection** object. 

The following built-in roles have these permissions by default:
- Application Administrator  
- Full Administrator  
- Infrastructure Administrator  
- Operations Administrator  
- OS Deployment Manager  

Add these permissions to any custom roles that need to push the client.


### Run script

Opens the **Run Script** wizard to run a PowerShell script on all of the clients in the collection. For more information, see [Create and run PowerShell scripts](/sccm/apps/deploy-use/create-deploy-scripts).

#### Permissions
This action requires the **Run Script** permission on the **Collection** object. 

The following built-in roles have this permission by default:
- Full Administrator  
- Infrastructure Administrator  
- Operations Administrator  

Add this permission to any custom roles that need to run scripts.


### Start CMPivot

Starts **CMPivot**, which runs real-time queries against the targeted devices. For more information, see [CMPivot](/sccm/core/servers/manage/cmpivot).

#### Permissions
This action requires the same permissions as the [Run script](#run-script) action. 

Starting in version 1906, you can use the **Run CMPivot** permission on the **Collection** object.


## Client notification

These actions are under the **Client notification** menu, on the ribbon in the Device or Collection group of the Home tab.

In version 1806 or earlier, the **Client Notification** option is only available from either the Device Collection node or when you viewed the membership of a Device Collection. Starting in version 1810, you can start a **Client Notification** directly from the **Devices** node. There's no longer a requirement to be within a collection membership view. <!--SCCMDocs-pr issue 2972-->

#### Permissions
<!--SCCMDocs-pr issue #2972-->
Starting in version 1810, client notification actions now require the **Notify Resource** permission on the Collection object. This permission applies to all actions under the **Client notification** menu. 

The following built-in roles have this permission by default:
- Full Administrator  
- Operations Administrator  

Add this permission to any custom roles that need to use client notification actions.
