# Add site system roles for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Each System Center Configuration Manager site supports multiple site system roles. Each role extends the functionality and capacity of your site to provide services to the site and to manage devices and users. Each site system role on a site system server must be from the same site.   

Configuration Manager does not support site system roles for multiple sites on a single site system server.  

> [!TIP]  
>  If you're not familiar with the basics for site system roles or the difference between the site server, site system servers, and site system roles, see [Fundamentals of System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/understand/fundamentals.md).  

 The following topics detail procedures and related details for installing site system roles:
