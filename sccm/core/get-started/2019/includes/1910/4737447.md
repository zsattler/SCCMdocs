## <a name="bkmk_wvd"></a> Improvements to Windows Virtual Desktop support

<!--4737447-->

Configuration Manager current branch version 1906 introduced support for [Windows Virtual Desktop](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-clients-and-devices#windows-virtual-desktop). If you require user policy in this scenario, and accept any potential performance impact, you can now configure a client setting to enable user policy. In the **Client Policy** group, configure the following setting: **Enable user policy for multiple user sessions**.
