## <a name="bkmk_sedo"></a> Reclaim SEDO lock

<!--4786915-->

If the Configuration Manager console stops responding, you can be locked out of making further changes until the lock expires after 30 minutes. This lock is part of the Configuration Manager SEDO (Serialized Editing of Distributed Objects) system. For more information, see [Configuration Manager SEDO](/sccm/develop/core/understand/sedo).

Starting in [current branch version 1906](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1906#reclaim-sedo-lock-for-task-sequences), you could clear your lock on a task sequence. Starting in this technical preview release, you can clear your lock on any object in the Configuration Manager console.

This action only applies to your user account that has the lock, and on the same device from which the site granted the lock. When you attempt to access a locked object, you can now **Discard Changes**, and continue editing the object. These changes would be lost anyway when the lock expired.
