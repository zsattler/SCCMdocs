## <a name="bkmk_sqlao"></a> Add a SQL AlwaysOn node

<!--3127336-->

You can now add a new secondary replica node to an existing SQL AlwaysOn availability group. Instead of a [manual process](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/configure-aoag#bkmk_sync), use Configuration Manager setup to make this change:

1. Use the [hierarchy maintenance tool](/sccm/core/servers/manage/hierarchy-maintenance-tool-preinst.exe) to stop the site: `preinst.exe /stopsite`

1. Modify the availability group using SQL Server procedures:

    1. [Create a backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-full-database-backup-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017) of the site database from the primary replica.

    1. [Restore that backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-database-backup-using-ssms?view=sql-server-2017) to the new secondary replica server.

    > [!Note]  
    > This process also works with removing a secondary replica node from a SQL AlwaysOn availability group. For more information, see [Remove a secondary replica from an availability group](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/remove-a-secondary-replica-from-an-availability-group-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017).

1. Run Configuration Manager setup, and select the option to modify the site.

1. Specify the availability group listener name as the database name. If the listener uses a non-standard network port, specify that as well. This action causes setup to make sure each node is appropriately configured. It also starts a database recovery process.

For more information on Configuration Manager support for SQL AlwaysOn, see the following articles:
