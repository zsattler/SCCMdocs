## <a name="bkmk_hub"></a> Improvements to Community Hub

<!--4224401-->

Aside from the existing support for scripts and reports, the Community Hub now supports the following objects:  

- Task sequences
- Applications
- Configuration items  

The hub doesn't share any package source content associated with these objects. For example, boot images, OS upgrade packages, or driver packages referenced by a task sequence.

The hub currently doesn't support object dependencies. For example, if you share app A that is dependent upon app B, it only shares app A with the community. Similarly, if a task sequence includes the Install Application step, the referenced apps aren't shared.

It removes any password or other secret from a task sequence before sharing.

For more information on Community Hub, including setup prerequisites and necessary permissions, see [Community hub and GitHub](/sccm/core/get-started/2019/technical-preview-1904#community-hub-and-github).
