## <a name="bkmk_tsdebug"></a> Improvements to task sequence debugger

This release includes the following improvements to the [task sequence debugger](/sccm/osd/deploy-use/debug-task-sequence):

- Use the new task sequence variable **TSDebugOnError** to automatically start the debugger when the task sequence returns an error. Set this variable using the [Set Task Sequence Variable](/sccm/osd/understand/task-sequence-steps#BKMK_SetTaskSequenceVariable) step, or as a collection variable.<!-- 5012536 --> For more information, see [How to set variables](/sccm/osd/understand/using-task-sequence-variables#bkmk_set).

- If you create a breakpoint in the debugger, and then the task sequence restarts the computer, the debugger keeps the breakpoints after restart.<!-- 5012509 -->
