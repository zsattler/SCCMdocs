# Choose a device management solution for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Configuration Manager offers different solutions for managing PCs, servers, and devices. Choose the solution that's right for your organization. Base your decision on the device platforms you need to manage and the management functionality you need.  


> [!Important]  
> As of August 14, 2018, hybrid mobile device management is a [deprecated feature](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures). For more information, see [What is hybrid MDM](/sccm/mdm/understand/hybrid-mobile-device-management).<!--Intune feature 2683117-->  
<!-- SCCMDocs issue 1197 -->



## Overview

This article covers the following four device management solutions: 
- [Configuration Manager client](#bkmk_sccm)
- [On-premises mobile device management (MDM) with Configuration Manager](#bkmk_opmdm)
- [Co-management with Microsoft Intune](#bkmk_comanage)
- [Microsoft Exchange](#bkmk_opmdm)

You can use these device management solutions by themselves or in combination with each other. For example, you can use the client-based management approach to manage the computers and servers in your organization, and also use co-management to manage internet-based laptops. By combining approaches this way, you can cover all of your device management needs.  

The article also includes two tables that compare the management solutions by the following factors: 
- [Compare by supported platforms](#bkmk_comp1)
- [Compare by management functionality](#bkmk_comp2)


### <a name="bkmk_sccm"></a> Configuration Manager client  

This option requires installation of the Configuration Manager client on devices. It provides the most features for managing PCs, servers, and other devices in your environment. 

For more information, see [Client installation methods](/sccm/core/clients/deploy/plan/client-installation-methods).  


### <a name="bkmk_opmdm"></a> On-premises MDM  

This option uses the device management capabilities built into Windows 10. While not as full-featured as client-based management, on-premises mobile device management provides a lighter touch approach to management. It uses on-premises Configuration Manager resources to manage devices.  

For more information, see [Manage mobile devices with on-premises infrastructure](/sccm/mdm/understand/manage-mobile-devices-with-on-premises-infrastructure).  


### <a name="bkmk_comanage"></a> Co-management with Microsoft Intune

Co-management is one of the primary ways to attach your existing Configuration Manager deployment to the Microsoft 365 cloud. It enables you to concurrently manage Windows 10 devices by using both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. Co-management lets you cloud-attach your existing investment in Configuration Manager by adding new functionality. 

For more information, see [What is co-management?](/sccm/comanage/overview).  


### <a name="bkmk_exchange"></a> Microsoft Exchange  

This option uses the Exchange Server connector to connect multiple Exchange servers to Configuration Manager. This centralizes management of devices that can connect to Exchange ActiveSync. You can configure Exchange mobile device management features from the Configuration Manager console. Example features include remote device wipe and the settings control for multiple Exchange servers.

For more information, see [Manage mobile devices with Configuration Manager and Exchange](/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/manage-mobile-devices-with-exchange-activesync).
