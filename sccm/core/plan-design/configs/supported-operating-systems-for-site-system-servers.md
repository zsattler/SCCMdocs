*Applies to Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1: Standard, Enterprise, and Datacenter*

Windows Server 2008 R2 is now in extended support and no longer in mainstream support, as detailed in [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). For more information about future support for these operating systems as site system servers with Configuration Manager, see [Deprecated server operating systems](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-server#server-os).  

> [!Important]  
> The extended support end date for Windows Server 2008 R2 is January 14, 2020. After this date, Configuration Manager won't support this OS as any site system role. 

This OS isn't supported for site servers or most site system roles. It's still supported for the distribution point site system role, including pull-distribution points and for PXE and multicast.

#### Site system servers
-   Distribution point <sup>[Note 1](#bkmk_note1)</sup>  

    - Distribution points on this OS support PXE and multicast.  



## <a name="bkmk_2008sp2"></a> Windows Server 2008 with SP2  

*Applies to Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2 (x86, x64): Standard, Enterprise, and Datacenter*

Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2 (SP2) is now in extended support and no longer in mainstream support, as detailed in [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). For more information about future support for these operating systems as site system servers with Configuration Manager, see [Deprecated server operating systems](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-server#server-os).  

> [!Important]  
> The extended support end date for Windows Server 2008 R2 is January 14, 2020. After this date, Configuration Manager won't support this OS as any site system role. 

This OS isn't supported for site servers or site system roles, except for the distribution point and pull-distribution point. Continue to use this OS as a distribution point until deprecation of this support is announced, or this OS's extended support period expires. For more information, see [Installation of Configuration Manager CB and LTSB fails on Windows Server 2008](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4015095).

#### Site system servers
-   Distribution point <sup>[Note 1](#bkmk_note1)</sup>  

    -   Distribution points on this OS support PXE and multicast.  

    -   Distribution points on this OS don't support network booting of client computers in EFI mode. Client computers with BIOS or with EFI booting in legacy mode are supported.  

> [!Warning]  
> Windows Server 2008 doesn't support TLS 1.2. If you enable this protocol in your environment, Windows Server 2008 computers will no longer communicate with the site. For more information, see [How to enable TLS 1.2 for Configuration Manager](/sccm/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2).  


## <a name="bkmk_client"></a> Client OS versions

Starting in version 1806, you can PXE-enable a distribution point on this OS with the option to **Enable a PXE responder without Windows Deployment Service**. For more information, see [Install and configure distribution points](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/install-and-configure-distribution-points#bkmk_config-pxe).

## General notes

#### <a name="bkmk_note1"></a> Note 1: Distribution points
Distribution points support several different configurations that each have different requirements. In some cases, these configurations support installation not only on servers, but on client operating systems. For more information, see [Manage content and content infrastructure](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/manage-content-and-content-infrastructure).  

#### <a name="bkmk_note2"></a> Note 2: Site database servers
Site database servers aren't supported on a read-only domain controller (RODC). For more information, see the Microsoft Support article: [You may encounter problems when installing SQL Server on a domain controller](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2032911). 

Additionally, secondary site servers aren't supported on any domain controller.
