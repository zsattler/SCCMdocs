# Site and site system prerequisites for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Windows-based computers require specific configurations to support their use as Configuration Manager site system servers.

This article primarily focuses on [Windows Server 2012 and later](#bkmk_2012Prereq). [Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008](#bkmk_2008) are supported for the distribution point site system role. For more information, see [Supported operating systems for site system servers](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-site-system-servers).

For some products, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the software update point, you need to refer to the product documentation to identify additional prerequisites and limitations for use. Only configurations that directly apply for use with Configuration Manager are included here.

For more information on .NET Framework, see [Lifecycle FAQ - .NET Framework](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17455/lifecycle-faq-net-framework).


## <a name="bkmk_generalprerewq"></a> General requirements and limitations

The following requirements apply to all site system servers:

- Each site system server must use a 64-bit OS. The only exception is the distribution point site system role, which you can install on some 32-bit operating systems.  

- Site systems aren't supported on Server Core installations of any operating system. An exception is that Server Core installations are supported for the distribution point site system role. For more information, see [Supported operating systems for Configuration Manager site system servers](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-site-system-servers).  

- After a site system server is installed, it's not supported to change:  

    - The domain name of the domain where the site system computer is located (also called a **domain rename**).  

    - The domain membership of the computer.  

    - The name of the computer.  

    If you must change any of these items, first remove the site system role from the computer. Then reinstall the role after the change is complete. For changes affecting the site server, first uninstall the site. Then reinstall the site after the change is complete.  

- Site system roles aren't supported on an instance of a Windows Server cluster. The only exception is the site database server. For more information, see [Use a SQL Server cluster for the Configuration Manager site database](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/use-a-sql-server-cluster-for-the-site-database).  

    Starting in version 1810, the Configuration Manager setup process no longer blocks installation of the site server role on a computer with the Windows role for Failover Clustering. SQL Always On requires this role, so previously you couldn't colocate the site database on the site server. With this change, you can create a highly available site with fewer servers by using SQL Always On and a site server in passive mode. For more information, see [High availability options](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/high-availability-options). <!--3607761, fka 1359132-->  

- It's not supported to change the startup type or "Log on as" settings for any Configuration Manager service. If you do, you might prevent key services from running correctly.

### Visual C++ Redistributable  

- Configuration Manager installs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package on each computer that installs a site server.  

- Central administration sites and primary sites require both the x86 and x64 versions of the applicable redistributable file.  

### SQL Server Native Client

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Make sure this component is up to date. For more information, see [Prerequisite checks - SQL Server Native Client](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks#sql-server-native-client).


## <a name="bkmk_2012secpreq"></a> Secondary site server

- [Lifecycle FAQ - .NET Framework](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17455/lifecycle-faq-net-framework)

### Visual C++ Redistributable

- Configuration Manager installs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package on each computer that installs a site server.  

- Secondary sites require only the x64 version.  

### Default site system roles  

- By default, a secondary site installs a **management point** and a **distribution point**.  

- Ensure that the secondary site server meets the prerequisites for these site system roles.  

### SQL Server Native Client

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Make sure this component is up to date. For more information, see [Prerequisite checks - SQL Server Native Client](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks#sql-server-native-client).


## <a name="bkmk_2012dbpreq"></a> Database server  

### Remote Registry service  

- During installation of the Configuration Manager site, enable the **Remote Registry** service on the computer that hosts the site database.  

### SQL Server  

- Before you install a central administration site or primary site, install a supported version of SQL Server to host the site database. For more information, see [Supported SQL Server versions](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-sql-server-versions).  

- Before you install a secondary site, you can install a supported version of SQL Server.  

- If you choose to have Configuration Manager install SQL Server Express as part of the secondary site installation, ensure that the computer meets the requirements to run SQL Server Express.  

### SQL Server Native Client

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Make sure this component is up to date. For more information, see [Prerequisite checks - SQL Server Native Client](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks#sql-server-native-client).


## <a name="bkmk_2012smsprovpreq"></a> SMS Provider server  

### Windows ADK

- The computer where you install an instance of the SMS Provider must have the required version of the Windows ADK that the version of Configuration Manager you're installing or upgrading to requires. For more information, see [Windows 10 ADK](/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/support-for-windows-10#windows-10-adk).  

- For more information about this requirement, see [Infrastructure requirements for operating system deployment](/sccm/osd/plan-design/infrastructure-requirements-for-operating-system-deployment).  

### Windows Server roles and features

- If you're using the [administration service](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider#bkmk_admin-service), the server that hosts the SMS Provider role requires .NET 4.5.2 or later  <!-- SCCMDocs issue #1203 -->
    - Starting in version 1902, this prerequisite is version .NET 4.5 or later.

- Web Server (IIS): Every provider attempts to install the [administration service](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider#bkmk_admin-service). This service has a dependency on IIS to bind a certificate to HTTPS port 443. Configuration Manager uses IIS APIs to check this certificate configuration. If you configure the site for [Enhanced HTTP](/sccm/core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http), Configuration Manager uses IIS APIs to bind the SCCM-generated certificate.

### SQL Server Native Client

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Make sure this component is up to date. For more information, see [Prerequisite checks - SQL Server Native Client](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks#sql-server-native-client).


## <a name="bkmk_2012acwspreq"></a> Application catalog website point  

> [!Important]  
> The application catalog's Silverlight user experience isn't supported as of current branch version 1806. Starting in version 1906, updated clients automatically use the management point for user-available application deployments. You also can't install new application catalog roles. In the first current branch release after October 31, 2019, support will end for the application catalog roles.

- The instance that you use for SQL Server Reporting Services can be the same instance you use for the site database.  

- Additionally, the instance that you use can be shared with other System Center products, as long as the other System Center products don't have restrictions for sharing the instance of SQL Server.  

### SQL Server Native Client

When you install a new site, Configuration Manager automatically installs SQL Server Native Client as a redistributable component. After the site is installed, Configuration Manager doesn't upgrade SQL Server Native Client. Make sure this component is up to date. For more information, see [Prerequisite checks - SQL Server Native Client](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/install/list-of-prerequisite-checks#sql-server-native-client).

Enable the Windows feature for .NET Framework 3.5.

Also install a supported version of the .NET Framework version 4.5 or later. Starting in version 1906, Configuration Manager supports .NET Framework 4.8.

> [!Note]
> When this site system role installs, Configuration Manager automatically installs the .NET Framework 4.5.2. This installation can place the server into a reboot pending state. If a reboot is pending for the .NET Framework, .NET applications might fail until after the server reboots and the installation finishes.

## <a name="bkmk_2008"></a> Prerequisites for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008  

Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are now in extended support and are no longer in mainstream support, as detailed by the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). For more information about future support for these operating systems as site system servers with Configuration Manager, see [Removed and deprecated server operating systems](/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-server#server-os).  

These OS versions aren't supported for site servers or most site system roles. They're still supported for the distribution point site system role, including pull-distribution points and for PXE and multicast.

### IIS configuration

You can use the default IIS configuration or a custom configuration. To use a custom IIS configuration, you must enable the following options for IIS:  

- Application Development:  

    - ISAPI Extensions  

- Security:  

    - Windows Authentication  

- IIS 6 Management Compatibility:  

    - IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility  

    - IIS 6 WMI Compatibility  

When you use a custom IIS configuration, you can remove options that aren't required, such as the following items:  

- Common HTTP Features:  

    - HTTP Redirection  

- IIS Management Scripts and Tools  

### Windows feature  

- Remote Differential Compression  

### Visual C++ Redistributable

- Configuration Manager installs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package on each computer that hosts a distribution point.  

- The version that is installed depends on the computer's platform (x86 or x64).  

### To support PXE or multicast  

- Install and configure the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) Windows Server role.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > WDS installs and configures automatically when you configure a distribution point to support PXE or multicast on a server that runs Windows Server 2012 or later.  

- Starting in version 1806, enable a PXE responder on a distribution point without Windows Deployment Service.  

For more information, see [Install and configure distribution points](/sccm/core/servers/deploy/configure/install-and-configure-distribution-points#bkmk_config-pxe).

<!--sms.503672 -Clarified BITS use-->
> [!NOTE]  
> When the distribution point transfers content, it transfers using the **Background Intelligent Transfer Service** (BITS) built into the Windows operating system. The distribution point role doesn't require the optional BITS IIS Server Extension feature to be installed because the client does not  upload information to it.
