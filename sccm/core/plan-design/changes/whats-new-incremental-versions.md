# What's new in Configuration Manager incremental versions

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Configuration Manager uses an in-console [updates and servicing](/sccm/core/servers/manage/updates) process. This update process makes it easy to discover and install Configuration Manager updates. There are no more service packs or cumulative update versions to track and install. You don't have to search for the download of the most recent release or updates.

To update the product to a new version of the current branch, use the Configuration Manager console to find and then [install in-console updates](/sccm/core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates). A few times each year, Microsoft releases new versions that include product updates. Each version also introduces new features. When you install an update with new features, you can choose to use those features.

Different update versions are identified by year and month. For example, version 1511 identifies November 2015 (the month when Configuration Manager current branch was first released to manufacturing). Later updates have version names like 1802, which indicates an update that was created in February 2018. These update versions are key to understanding the incremental version of your Configuration Manager installation, and what features are available to enable in your environment.
