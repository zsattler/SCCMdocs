# Assets in Desktop Analytics

After devices report data to Desktop Analytics, it provides an inventory of the following assets:

- Devices
- Installed apps  

In the service portal, select **Assets** in the Desktop Analytics menu.


## Devices

The **Devices** tab displays key information about all devices in your organization that you enroll to Desktop Analytics. You can sort on any column or filter for particular values.

> [!NOTE]  
> If the dashboard isn't reporting the number of devices you expect to see for your environment, see [Desktop Analytics troubleshooting](/sccm/desktop-analytics/troubleshooting).  

In a deployment plan, there's more detail about devices. For more information, see [Plan assets](/sccm/desktop-analytics/about-deployment-plans#plan-assets)

## Apps

The **Apps** tab shows all installed apps that the service detects on your Windows devices.

**Noteworthy** apps are installed on more than 2% of enrolled devices.

Configure the **Importance** of apps by setting one of the following categories:

- Critical
- Important
- Ignore 
- Not reviewed
- Not important<!-- 3587232 -->


Select the app from the list, and select **Edit**. This action displays details for the app. Select the **Importance** drop-down menu and set a value. You can also assign an **Owner**. If you make any changes, select **Save**.

<!-- 3587232 -->
Identifying **Importance** and **Upgrade Decision** is critical for all noteworthy apps in the Desktop Analytics workflow. To help reduce your efforts in annotating these apps, certain types of apps are automatically marked as *Not important*. The deployment plan upgrade decision for these apps is also marked as *Ready*. The following apps are compatible and should continue to work after you upgrade Windows:

- System apps and components published by Microsoft

- Apps managed and updated from the Microsoft Store

> [!Tip]
> Manage inputs for any app at a global level or per deployment plan. 
>
> 1. In the Desktop Analytics portal, in the **Manage** menu, select **Assets**. Then select **Apps**.
>
> 2. Use the **Type** and **Category** columns to manage these app categories:
>
>    - For store apps, filter **Type** as **Modern**
>    - For system apps, filter **Category** as **Background process** or **Windows component**



In a deployment plan, you can also set the **Upgrade decision**. For more information, see [Plan assets](/sccm/desktop-analytics/about-deployment-plans#plan-assets)
