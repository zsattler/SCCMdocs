# Updates in Desktop Analytics

In the Desktop Analytics portal, view the status of security and feature updates. Select these nodes in the Monitor group of the Desktop Analytics main menu. These nodes give you insights into the status of these updates in your environment.


## Security updates

To review the current status of security updates, select **Security updates** in the **Monitor** section of Desktop Analytics:

![Security updates node of Desktop Analytics](media/security-updates.png)

This view summarizes *security* updates for devices that are running Windows 10. Devices in the bar chart are categorized by the following labels:

#### Latest

Devices are running the latest security update for that version and channel.

#### Latest-1

Devices are running a security update one version older than the latest available update on that channel.

#### Older

Devices are running a security update older than Latest-1.

#### Not measured

Desktop Analytics hasn't assessed the device. This state includes devices running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 devices registered for the Windows Insider Program.  

If a Windows 10 device is *not authenticated* with a Microsoft account, Windows doesn't report this data. This authentication is typically completed as part of the Windows Setup out-of-box-experience (OOBE).<!-- 5148153 -->
