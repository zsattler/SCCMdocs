# Configuration Manager Server Runtime Requirements
Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager server applications that are developed by using the Configuration Manager SDK, have the following runtime requirements.  

## Managed Code  

-   A supported version of Windows Server as defined in [Supported operating systems for System Center Configuration Manager site system servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/plan-design/configs/supported-operating-systems-for-site-system-servers). For more information, see [General Requirements](#general-requirements).

-   Installed Configuration Manager site server  

-   Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider .NET Framework assembly  

-   Microsoft .NET Framework version 4  

## Configuration Manager Console User Interface Extension  
 Programming System Center Configuration Manager console extensions has the following requirements:  

- Installed Configuration Manager site server  

- Installed Configuration Manager console  

- .NET Framework 4.0  

  For more information, see [About console extensions](/sccm/develop/core/servers/console/about-configuration-manager-console-extension).  

## VBScript  

-   Installed Configuration Manager site server  

-   Windows Script Host  

## Windows 64-Bit Support  
 A 32-bit compiled application that uses Configuration Manager SDK interfaces to access Configuration Manager client or Configuration Manager server functionality works when it runs in 32-bit emulation on a 64-bit Windows operating system. However, a 64-bit compiled application that uses Configuration Manager SDK interfaces that access 32-bit Configuration Manager client or Configuration Manager server functionality does not work. Similarly, Configuration Manager SDK scripts do not work when the scripting host is a native 64-bit application. A Configuration Manager SDK script does work if it is called from within a 32-bit scripting host.  

## General Requirements
